# react-native-camera-color-picker
This react Native App lets you pick color from live camera preview with only a tap.

# Why This?
We decided to make an app that lets user pick colors from live camera preview. However, the already present solutions for this were either broke or none at all!
Thus we decided to create this app while utilizing native components highlighting the use of how react native creates a bridge between android and js thread. This 
allows the user to use the image library from java in android in react native directly.
